Originally from Kentucky, I started my formal art education at Midway College, and continued later at Southwest College in California. 

The Charcoal here (48" X 48") is my final project in Life Drawing Class at Everett Community College.	 
We had to reproduce a selected Caravaggio painting ("The Calling of Saint Matthew") 
and insert our self image (I'm in the middle).

I have lived in several areas of the U.S. and have enjoyed reliving some of my travels through the creation of original paintings. 
I hope to continue my travel experiences abroad one day, but for now my family and friends share their travel experiences through photographic images, which sparks my imagination and inspires some of my paintings. 

To create my art, I like to go out and take photos of objects and people around me. Sometimes I will combine different photographic images to inspire a painting and sometimes the single image alone will stir the creative juices. I typically like to use vibrant colors in my paintings to offset our dismal Northwest days.
